# WIP: Instructor/Studio Directory
This plugin will create a searchable directory, which can be filtered using geolocation. It will also allow instrucotrs to register and add their own profiles to the searchable posts. A user role is added for instructors and they are not able to get into the actual admin area, rather a small admin area is created for them. It requires the use of Advanced Custom Fields and a [geolocation field extension](https://github.com/bobbyleftovers/acf-mapbox-field) for ACF that I created. It is namespaced to prevent crashing into other plugins and uses VueJS for the frontend.
