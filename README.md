# WIP: Instructor/Studio Directory
This plugin will create a searchable directory, which can be filtered using geolocation. It will also allow instrucotrs to ad their own profiles to the searchable posts. It requires the use of Advanced Custom Fields and a geolocation field extension for ACF that I created. It is namespaced to prevent crashing into other plugins and uses VueJS for the frontend.
